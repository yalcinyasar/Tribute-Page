                    <strong>Sir David Frederick Attenborough</strong> (/ˈætənbərə/; born 8 May 1926) is an English
                    broadcaster, natural historian and author. He is best known for writing and presenting, in
                    conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series forming
                    the Life collection that constitute a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attenborough is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and
                    director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. His filmography as writer,
                    presenter and narrator spans eight decades; it includes Zoo Quest, Natural World, Wildlife on One,
                    the Planet Earth franchise, The Blue Planet and its sequel. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs
                    for programmes in black and white, colour, high-definition, 3D and 4K resolutions.

                    While Attenborough's earlier work focused more on the wonders of the natural world, his later work
                    has been more vocal in support of environmental causes. He has advocated for restoring planetary
                    biodiversity, limiting population growth, renewable energy, reducing meat consumption, and setting
                    aside more areas for natural preservation. He has been criticised for expressing controversial views
                    on human overpopulation. He considers his 2020 documentary film, David Attenborough: A Life On Our
                    Planet, his personal witness statement of his life and the future.

                    On his broadcasting and passion for nature, NPR stated he "roamed the globe and shared his
                    discoveries and enthusiasms with his patented semi-whisper way of narrating". In 2018 and 2019,
                    Attenborough received Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Narrator. He is widely considered a
                    national treasure in the UK, although he himself does not like the term. He is the younger brother
                    of the late director, producer and actor Richard Attenborough, and older brother of the late motor
                    executive John Attenborough.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Attenborough was born on 8 May 1926 in Isleworth, Middlesex, and grew up in College House on
                    the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal. He
                    is the middle of three long-lived sons; his elder brother, Richard (died in 2014), became an actor
                    and director, and his younger brother, John (died in 2012), was an executive at Italian car
                    manufacturer Alfa Romeo. During the Second World War, through a British volunteer network known
                    as the Refugee Children's Movement, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from
                    Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones, and natural specimens. He received
                    encouragement, when a young Jacquetta Hawkes admired his collection. He spent much time in the
                    grounds of the university, and, aged around 11, he heard that the zoology department needed a large
                    supply of newts, which he offered through his father to supply for 3d each. The source, which he did
                    not
                    reveal at the time, was a pond right next to the department. A year later, one of his adoptive
                    sisters, Marianne, gave him a piece of amber containing prehistoric creatures; some sixty years
                    later,
                    it would be the focus of his programme The Amber Time Machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1936, Attenborough and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) at
                    De
                    Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard,
                    David was "bowled over by the man's determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of
                    the
                    flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the
                    delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that mankind was endangering nature by
                    recklessly
                    despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained
                    part of
                    Dave's own credo to this day." In 1999, Richard directed a biopic of Belaney entitled Grey Owl.

                    Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester, where he won a
                    scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in 1945 to study geology and zoology and obtained a degree
                    in
                    natural sciences. In 1947, he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two
                    years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In 1950, Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth
                    Ebsworth Oriel. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Jane died in 1997. Robert is a senior
                    lecturer in bioanthropology for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian
                    National
                    University in Canberra. Susan is a former primary school headmistress.

                    Attenborough had a pacemaker fitted in June 2013, as well as a double knee replacement in 2015. In
                    September 2013 he commented: "If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed
                    to
                    stop. But I'm not. I'm swanning round the world looking at the most fabulously interesting things.
                    Such
                    good fortune."

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>First years at the BBC</h3>
                <p>
                    After leaving the Navy, Attenborough took a position editing children's science textbooks for a
                    publishing company. He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a
                    radio talk producer with the BBC. Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the
                    interest of Mary Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling
                    television service. Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and
                    he had seen only one programme in his life. However, he accepted Adams' offer of a three-month
                    training course, and in 1952 he joined the BBC full-time. Initially discouraged from appearing on
                    camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big, he became a producer for the Talks
                    department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts. His early projects included the quiz show
                    Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? and Song Hunter, a series about folk music presented by Alan Lomax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attenborough's association with natural history programmes began when he produced and presented the
                    three-part series Animal Patterns. The studio-bound programme featured animals from London Zoo, with
                    the naturalist Julian Huxley discussing their use of camouflage, aposematism and courtship displays.
                    Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo's reptile house, and
                    they decided to make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was Zoo Quest, first
                    broadcast in 1954, where Attenborough became the presenter at short notice due to Lester being taken
                    ill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1957, the BBC Natural History Unit was formally established in Bristol. Attenborough was asked to
                    join it, but declined, not wishing to move from London where he and his young family were settled.
                    Instead, he formed his own department, the Travel and Exploration Unit, which allowed him to
                    continue to front Zoo Quest as well as produce other documentaries, notably the Travellers' Tales
                    and Adventure series. In the early 1960s, Attenborough resigned from the permanent staff of the
                    BBC to study for a postgraduate degree in social anthropology at the London School of Economics,
                    interweaving his study with further filming. However, he accepted an invitation to return to the
                    BBC as controller of BBC Two before he could finish the degree

                <h3>BBC administration</h3>
                <p>
                    Attenborough became Controller of BBC 2 in March 1965 succeeding Michael Peacock. He had a
                    clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional
                    basis. Later the same year he filmed elephants in Tanzania, and in 1969 he made a three-part series
                    on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of Bali. For the 1971 film A Blank on the Map, he
                    joined the first Western expedition to a remote highland valley in New Guinea to seek out a lost
                    tribe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BBC Two had been launched in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public's imagination. When
                    Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel's quirky kangaroo mascot and
                    shook up the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two's output diverse and different from that
                    offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the
                    channel's identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment,
                    archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all
                    found a place in the weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening's
                    viewing. Programmes he commissioned included Man Alive, Call My Bluff, Chronicle, Match of the Day,
                    The Old Grey Whistle Test, Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Money Programme. With the
                    addition of colour television, Attenborough brought snooker to the BBC to show the benefits of the
                    format, as the sport uses coloured balls. The show - Pot Black was later credited with the boom
                    of the sport into the 1980s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of his most significant decisions was to order a 13-part series on the history of Western art,
                    to show off the quality of the new UHF colour television service that BBC Two offered. Broadcast to
                    universal acclaim in 1969, Civilisation set the blueprint for landmark authored documentaries, which
                    were informally known as "sledgehammer" projects. Others followed, including Jacob
                    Bronowski's The Ascent of Man (also commissioned by Attenborough), and Alistair Cooke's America.
                    Attenborough thought that the story of evolution would be a natural subject for such a series. He
                    shared his idea with Christopher Parsons, a producer at the Natural History Unit, who came up with a
                    title Life on Earth and returned to Bristol to start planning the series. Attenborough harboured a
                    strong desire to present the series himself, but this would not be possible so long as he remained
                    in a management post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While in charge of BBC Two, Attenborough turned down Terry Wogan's job application to be a presenter
                    on the channel, stating that there weren't any suitable vacancies. The channel already had an Irish
                    announcer, with Attenborough reflecting in 2016: "To have had two Irishmen presenting on BBC Two
                    would have looked ridiculous. This is no comment whatsoever on Terry Wogan's talents."Attenborough
                    has also acknowledged that he sanctioned the wiping of programmes during this period to
                    cut costs, including sketches by Alan Bennett, which he later regretted. In 1969 Attenborough
                    was promoted to director of programmes, making him responsible for the output of both BBC channels.
                    His tasks, which included agreeing budgets, attending board meetings and firing staff, were now far
                    removed from the business of filming programmes. When Attenborough's name was being suggested as a
                    candidate for the position of Director-General of the BBC in 1972, he phoned his brother Richard to
                    confess that he had no appetite for the job. Early the following year, he left his post to return to
                    full-time programme-making, leaving him free to write and present the planned natural history
                    epic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After his resignation, Attenborough became a freelance broadcaster and started work on his next
                    project, a trip to Indonesia with a crew from the Natural History Unit. It resulted in the 1973
                    series Eastwards with Attenborough, which was similar in tone to the earlier Zoo Quest; the main
                    difference was the introduction of colour. Attenborough stated that he wanted to work in Asia, as
                    nature documentaries had mostly focused on Africa. That year, Attenborough was invited to
                    deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The Language of Animals. After his work on
                    Eastwards with Attenborough, he began to work on the scripts for Life on Earth. Due to the scale of
                    his ambition, the BBC decided to partner with an American network to secure the necessary funding.
                    While the negotiations were proceeding, he worked on a number of other television projects. He
                    presented a series on tribal art (The Tribal Eye, 1975) and another on the voyages of discovery (The
                    Explorers, 1975). He also presented a BBC children's series about cryptozoology entitled
                    Fabulous Animals (1975), which featured mythical creatures such as mermaids and unicorns.
                    Eventually the BBC signed a co-production deal with Turner Broadcasting and Life on Earth moved into
                    production in 1976.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    David Attenborough's television credits span eight decades and his association with natural history
                    programmes dates back to The Pattern of Animals and Zoo Quest in the early 1950s. His most
                    influential work, 1979's Life on Earth, launched a strand of nine authored documentaries with the
                    BBC Natural History Unit which shared the Life strand name and spanned 30 years. He narrated every
                    episode of the long-running BBC series Wildlife on One and in his later career has voiced several
                    high-profile BBC wildlife documentaries, among them The Blue Planet and Planet Earth. He became a
                    pioneer in the 3D documentary format with Flying Monsters in 2010.

                <h2>Bibliography</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>David Attenborough's work as an author has strong parallels with his broadcasting career. In the
                    1950s and 1960s, his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around
                    the world, which became the Zoo Quest series. He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine
                    Life documentaries, along with books on tribal art and birds of paradise. His autobiography, Life on
                    Air, was published in 2002, revised in 2009 and is one of a number of his works which is available
                    as a self-narrated audiobook. Attenborough has also contributed forewords and introductions to many
                    other works, notably those accompanying Planet Earth, Frozen Planet, Africa and other BBC series he
                    has narrated.</p>

                <p>
                    “It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement; the greatest source of
                    visual beauty; the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in
                    life that makes life worth living.”
